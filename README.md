# WDI SF Summer 2014 Repo

This repo holds my notes, resources and serves files for a github pages/angular app to aggregate the blog feeds of my classmates. 

All of my cohortees are welcome to fork, clone add whatever you want (anything - graphics, animations, widgets, refactors, etc.), and send me a pull request.

6 months or a year from now, when we want to find something we discussed during week 2 or just reminisce...it'll be here.
