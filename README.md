# WDI SF Summer 2014 Repo

This repo holds my notes, resources and serves files for an angular app to aggregate the blog feeds of my classmates. View the live app here: [http://marklc44.github.io/wdi-sf-summer-2014/](http://marklc44.github.io/wdi-sf-summer-2014/).

## If You're Summer Cohortee (is that a word?)
You're welcome to fork, clone, add whatever you want (anything - graphics, animations, widgets, refactors, etc.), and send me a pull request.

### I'm looking for ideas from classmates for:
1. Resources to add
2. How best to aggregate notes
3. Any other ideas to make this a resource we can refer to in perpetuity

6 months or a year from now, when we want to find something we discussed during week 2 or just reminisce...it'll be here.

## To Do
1. Filter for photo posts
2. Filter to check which img thumbnail sizes exist
2. Unescape HTML in post excerpts
3. Better styling
4. Add service for Wordpress blogs - requires oAuth2
5. Organized notes area
6. Organized resources area
7. Modularize the pages, menu and routing in angular to create more pages
